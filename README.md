# RSVP Movies

RSVP (an Indian Film Production company) wants to enter the global market and we've found key insights that might be useful for them in this new venture.

In this SQL-based case study, we've done a complete EDA and answered important questions like:

-- Who are the sought after directors? 

-- What kind of genres does the general public like?

-- Who are the top actors and actresses of this generation?

-- Is there a language preference?

-- Who are our competitors?

And much more.
