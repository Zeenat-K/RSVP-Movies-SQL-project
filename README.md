RSVP (an Indian Film Production company) wants to enter the global market and we've found key insights that might be useful for them in this new venture.

In this SQL-based case study, we've aggregate and prepped 3 years of movie data (2018-2022) and answered important questions like:

* Who are the sought after directors? 
* What kind of genres does the general public like?
* Who are the top actors and actresses of this generation?
* Is there a language preference?
* Who are our competitors?

And much more.
