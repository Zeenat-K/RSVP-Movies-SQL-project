# RSVP Movies

We have the data of movies released in the years (2018-2022). Considering the usecase that RSVP (an Indian Film Production company) wants to enter the global market, we've found key insights that might be useful for them.

In this SQL-based case study, we've done a complete EDA and answered key questions like:

-- Who are the sought after directors? 

-- What kind of genres does the general public like?

-- Who are the top actors and actresses of this generation?

-- Is there a language preference?

-- Who are our competitors?

And many more
